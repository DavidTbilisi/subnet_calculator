                    p A, B, C - Unicast

                        p Class A IP addresses are used for very large networks, such as a major international corporation might have.

                        p 127 is reserved for loopback and is not a valid IP address.
                        p 0 is reserved for default route and is not a valid IP address.

                p RFC 793 - Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a connection-oriented protocol that provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of a stream of octets between applications running on hosts communicating over an IP network. TCP is used by application protocols such as HTTP, SMTP, Telnet, and FTP.
